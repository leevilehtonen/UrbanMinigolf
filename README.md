# UrbanMinigolf
2D Minigolf game written in Java. Created as a part of [course](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/courses/582221/2017/k/a/1).

### Usage
Run the jar with `java -jar <FILENAME>.jar`.

Gamewindow should open with the first map. Playing the game is very easy: the diretion of hit is controlled with mouse (the direction is the blackline from the ball). By clicking the mouse you can hit the ball, but only when the ball is still. After beating a level you are automatically taken to a next level. After beating all the levels score is shown and the game will automatically quit.
